# II - DATA PIPELINES

## The aim of this project is to build a data pipeline to enrich an existing public dataset. For this goal, multiple public datasets will be combined together with a database scrapped from a website.


## As we all know, there is a growing tendency to purchase electric cars. Not only they are becoming popular but also governments are fostering it by providing aids for people to purchase electric cars.

### This project goal is to democratize data about electric cars evolution and its enviromental and health impac, if any.


#### The chosen scrapped dataset was "World-most-polluted-countries" from iqair.com. The scrapped table provides historical data about the most polluted country and region ranking based on annual average PM2.5 concentration (μg/m³).

####  In order to enrich this dataset, 3 other indicators will be considered and added: 1) charging points around the world, 2) sales cars history, 3) EV stock share and 4) number of deaths by risk factor

The following hypotheses were formulated to guide the analysis:

- The more charging stations, the higher the sales.
- The higher stock share, the higher the sales.
- The higher the sales, the less deaths.
- The more sales, the less the pollution.
